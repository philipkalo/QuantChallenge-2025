# QuantChallenge-2025
Python code that was used for the "Data" section of QuantChallenge 2025. 

The scripts employ different machine and deep learning models in order to predict the prices of two different assets based on market data. The objective of this part of the competition was to create the model with the highest accuracy in price estimation (through comparison of $R^2$ values with actual market data). The performance of our algorithms was evaluated through the application of standard statistical metrics. The team was awarded $1^{\text{st}}$ prize in the competition overall and this GitHub respotistory contains my contributions to the code.
